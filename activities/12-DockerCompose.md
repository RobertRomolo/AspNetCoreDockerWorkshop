# Docker Compose

For this activity, please ensure you have completed [Activity 11](11-ProductionDockerfile.md).

## What's the plan?

We're going to add a docker-compose file to support running our application without having to recall the docker switch to expose ports. We'll also override the configuration for the application at runtime of the container by passing in an environment variable.

## Activity Steps

1. Create a new text document in the root directory called 'docker-compose.yml'.
2. Edit the 'docker-compose.yml' in VS Code or Notepad (or your text editor of choice) and add the following...

```
version: '3'

services:

  api-service:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
     - "10001:80"
    environment:
      - "Messages__WelcomeMessage=Hello from Docker"
    container_name: sample-api-service
```

3. Save the file.
4. Open a command prompt window in the same directory as the Docker compose file.
5. Run the compose file using the docker-compose command...


```
docker-compose up -d
```
*The -d switch starts in detached mode*

6. Open a browser window and navigate to [http://localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001/).

*Note that the welcome message has been loaded from the environment variable set in the compose file*

7. In the command prompt, view the running containers

```
docker-compose ps
```

8. Stop the container...

```
docker-compose stop
```
